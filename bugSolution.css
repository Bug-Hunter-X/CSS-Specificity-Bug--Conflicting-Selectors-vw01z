The solution involves understanding and addressing CSS specificity.  One approach is to use more specific selectors to clearly define which styles should apply to which elements.  Another approach involves utilizing the `!important` flag; however, it should be used sparingly to avoid creating future maintenance problems.  Here's an example of a revised CSS with improved specificity:

```css
div > p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this solution, `div > p` has higher specificity than `p` because it includes a child selector (`>`), which ensures that only paragraphs which are direct children of a `div` element will be styled blue.  This makes the styling more predictable and maintainable.
