The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

In this example, both selectors target the same element, a paragraph (`p`) element within a `div` element.  The first selector (`div p`) is more specific because it targets paragraphs that are specifically inside a `div`.  However, unexpected behavior might arise if the element structure changes or if other, even more specific selectors, are involved.
